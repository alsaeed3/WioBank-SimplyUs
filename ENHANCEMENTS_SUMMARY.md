- `presentation_demo.js`: Script to add multiple demo SMS messages automatically
- `send_demo_sms.js`: Simple tool to send and parse individual SMS messages

### 3. Live Email Demo Tools
- `live_email_demo.js`: Interactive tool to simulate receiving and processing emails in real-time
- `run_live_email_demo.sh`: Script to automate the setup and running of the live email demo
- `EMAIL_DEMO_GUIDE.md`: Documentation on how to use the email demo during presentations

## How to Use Demo Tools

### Running the Dashboard Data Fix Script
```bash
node fix_dashboard_data.js
```
This script will:
- Add SMS messages with future due dates for dashboard's pending payments count
- Create realistic transaction data for spending charts

### Testing SMS Parsing During Presentation
```bash
node send_demo_sms.js "Your SMS message here" "Sender"
```
For example:
```bash
node send_demo_sms.js "Emirates NBD Credit Card Mini Stmt for Card ending 6889: Statement date 27/06/25. Total Amt Due AED 4,520.01, Due Date 22/07/25." "Emirates NBD"
```

### Running the Live Email Demo
```bash
bash run_live_email_demo.sh
```
This will:
- Check if the server is running (and start it if needed)
- Launch an interactive menu to simulate receiving emails
- Process statements and generate notifications in real-time

You can use this during your presentation to show:
- Real-time email processing
- Statement parsing and data extraction
- Notifications generated from email content
- Integration with the dashboard analytics
